​
## Project Overview
​
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.
​
What do I need to install? You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
​
2. Pandas
​
3. NumPy
​
4. Matplotlib
​
5. csv
​
It will be recommend to installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.
## Why This Project?
​
In this project, we have to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. I have also use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!
​
## What I Have Learn?
​
1. After completing the project, I have learned following :
​
2. Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
​
3. Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
​
4. Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
​
5. Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
​
6. Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
​
7. Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
​
8. Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
